      Optimize and improve the following typescript code. In your response, provide both the optimized code in full,
      and a description of the optimizations separately. Do not change the signatures of any public functions. You
      must explain your optimizations first, before the code.
      
      The typescript code follows:
      
      {{ trim .sourceCode }}
