# Notes on debugging

- all debug output goes to STDERR

You can chain multiple debug switches to one command

```bash
echo "hamster" | codeassistant run ascii-artist draw-object \
  --debug configuration --debug sent-prompt \
  --debug request-headers --debug response-headers
```

There are several ways to view PowerPoint (ppt) files on a Mac computer. Here are a few solutions:

1. Install Microsoft PowerPoint for Mac: Download and install Microsoft PowerPoint for Mac to open and view ppt files.

2. Use Keynote: Keynote is a presentation software developed by Apple that can open and edit PowerPoint files. Just drag and drop the ppt file onto the Keynote icon and it will open.

3. Convert the file to PDF: Convert the ppt file to a PDF file which can be viewed on any device using Preview, Adobe Acrobat, or any other PDF reader.

4. Use Google Slides: If you have a Google account, you can use Google Slides to open and view ppt files. Simply upload the file to Google Drive and open it in Google Slides.

I hope one of these solutions helps you to view your ppt files on your Mac.
