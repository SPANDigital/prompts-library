ASCII art is a form of visual representation where images and designs are created using a combination of characters from
the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) character set. By arranging letters, numbers, symbols,
and other ASCII characters in a specific pattern, artists can produce intricate and creative artworks that can be
displayed on computers and other digital platforms. From simple smiley faces to complex illustrations, ASCII art allows
for the expression of creativity within the constraints of text-based mediums, bridging the gap between visual art and
the digital world.
